$Sample
--------

The $sample stage in MongoDB's aggregation framework is used to select a random
 set of documents from a collection. This is helpful when you want to retrieve a 
random subset of documents for testing, analysis, or other purposes.

code:-
size: The number of random documents to return.

db.collection.aggregate([
  { $sample: { size: 2 } }
])


Explanation:-
The $sample stage randomly selects 2 documents from the collection.



output:-

[
  { "_id": 3, "item": "orange", "price": 8 },
  { "_id": 5, "item": "grapes", "price": 6 }
]
