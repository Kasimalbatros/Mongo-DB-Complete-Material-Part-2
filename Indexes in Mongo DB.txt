INDEXES used to increase the speed of query.
Ex: weh 10,000 documents and we want to search Air frier if i got this in all this in 100 documents
then searching seraching rest 9900 is waste of time. In this plcae Index plays a crucial rols


db.collection_name.explain();    ---> showing details

db.collection_name.explain("executionStats"); --> Show you timing speed and all details

Creating Indexes.
-------------------

db.collection_name.createIndex({"name":1});

Shwoing default Index created inside the collection
======================================================
db.collectioname.getIndex();


Dropping Index
-----------------
db.collectionname.dropIndex()


creating Unique Index ---> Read Youself


NOTE:-
when You dont need to use Indexes ?

1. When you know ,Approx 60% data will be returning  by the command then don't make indexes 
because indexes stores their data separately with collections. so it takes unnecessary space in memory
this leads take longer period of time to execute the codes.



Note:- Indexes is not imporatant in MongoDB  (learn just for interview perspective)
