$out
----
is used to write the result of an aggregation pipeline to a collection. 
It either creates a new collection or replaces the existing one with the result 
of the pipeline.

syntax:-

db.collection.aggregate([
  { <aggregation stages> },
  { $out: "<outputCollection>" }
])


Example:-

Assume we have below sample

[
  { "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "price": 10 },
  { "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "price": 5 },
  { "_id": 3, "item": "orange", "price": 8 }
]



command:-

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { price: { $gt: 7 } } },  // Filter documents with price > 7
  { $out: "expensiveOrders" }         // Write the result to a new collection
])


We want to filter the orders collection to include only documents where the price
 is greater than 7 and save this result into a new collection called expensiveOrders:


output:-
Result in the expensiveOrders collection: (orders collection result comes out on expensiveOrders collection)

[
  { "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "price": 10 },
  { "_id": 3, "item": "orange", "price": 8 }
]


Note:-  expensiveOrders collection newly created if Already exists with the same name then 
it above result is the overwritten. (This above result becomes your default result)
